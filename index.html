            <h1 class="heading">I recieved a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current,
                if not
                more
                so, in the
                company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.</h1>
            <p class="comment">"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a
                transition and
                have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
                found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most
                grueling - time of my life.Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a
                Software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

            <p class="comment">"The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The
                program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a
                capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need
                from an incredible community of smart and amazing people"</p>

            <p class="comment comment5">"Before the joing the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some
                structure from prfessionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll
                by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum
                and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The
                agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that
                no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
                development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
                multiple offers. 100% recommended! "</p>
