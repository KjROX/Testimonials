                transition and
                have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
                found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most
                grueling - time of my life.Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a
                Software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>
